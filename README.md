# Snake Game on PIC32

This repository contains the source code for a classic Snake game implemented on the PIC32 microcontroller using the **Uno32 development board**. The project leverages the board's **OLED graphical display** for the game's visual output and utilizes the **Basic I/O shield** for user input.

---

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a functional Snake game on the PIC32 platform that includes:

- Displaying the game on the OLED screen.
- Enabling snake movement in both X and Y directions.
- Implementing collision detection.
- Allowing the snake to "eat" apples to grow in size.
- Displaying the current score.

## Setup and Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Microchip **PIC32** microcontroller
- **Uno32** development board
- **Basic I/O shield** (for user input handling)

### Software Requirements

- **MPLAB X IDE**
- **XC32 Compiler**

---

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/snake-game-pic32.git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Open the project** in **MPLAB X IDE**.
2. **Configure** the project to use the **XC32 Compiler**.
3. **Connect** your **Uno32 board** to your computer.
4. **Build** the project and **upload** it to the Uno32 board.

---

### Usage

After uploading the game to the Uno32 board:

- Use the buttons on the **Basic I/O shield** to control the snake's movement.
- The goal is to **eat as many apples as possible** without colliding with the walls or the snake's tail.
